# Mutable Instruments Plaits Engine Reimplementation

This folder will contain C++ code reimplementing Plaits engines, one at a time, for the 5yn7h_ synth. All code will be original, but the sound and function will be as faithful as possible to the original Plaits engines. Wavetable-based engines will be skipped.
